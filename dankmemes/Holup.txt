Willing to hear any other comments, questions, or suggestions if you have them

shout out to u/generalofbread and others for caring enough to voice your concerns


edit: sorry I'll disable automod summoning me. I added that after seeing too many people casually barking out orders to susan as if I could see it. Well now I can. I will probably regret admitting this

edit 2 : yo wtf elfah's [shitpost](https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/comments/fdl0yf/rejoice) has like 5 times the upvotes?!? means I'm going to have to buy him a beer. thanks a lot, assholes

Yeah, the Facebook one needs to stop....

Could you please also add this rule to the subreddit's rules, so new posters will know?

Mods bisexual

nice video u/sloth_on_meth (   )

THATS BOOMER AS FUCK TRASH IS GONE

LETS GOOOOOO, TWITTER SCREENSHOTS ARE FINALLY BANNED

[it seems that the Facebook link is broken, as such I have made my own example](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouFellForItFool/comments/cjlngm/you_fell_for_it_fool/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

What about the pornhub comment section?

Fuckin finally goddamn. That "no no, hes got a point" at the bottom of a twitter screenshot was so fucking annoying i genuinely contemplated leaving the subreddit.

I have another question... would things like a picture of google information but edited count... for example a picture of "who was the communist leader of china" in the google search, and the result is a picture and description of Mr. Ping from kung fu panda?

Now if we can ban 69 and 420 memes I think this sub would get even better

i hereby promote you from homosexual to homosapien

Pretty sure Susan made these memes and is just upset everyone else is getting dank upvotes

Finally!!!

I have a question... would a scene from a movie count???

Mods still gay.

My god, thank you sir!

And shitty reaction images like ThEy hAd uS iN tHe FirSt hALf, nOt gOnNa LiE and oOf SiZe: LaRgE are still allowed?????

Banish the salute memes

Praise the lord of dank memes above.... for we have achieved salvation

If I want to report one, which r/dankmemes rule should I say it breaks? Will you add a new one for this? Or will it go under normie trash?

So user-written text with a reaction image is still okay? Just trying to figure all this out.

Looks like at least half the memes on this sub are hoing down...I'm glad they are though, thanks mods (mods bisexual)

les goo

Praise be the mods!

Finally

This sub might be good again

Now the shitty circlejerks like "nice" should be banned

#FINALLY

#LETS MAKE THIS SUB GREAT AGAIN

What about pornhub comments' screenshot? Are they allowed?

I run into the Facebook one pretty often.

Im happy we are making this change, it needed to happen

This may be the best thing mods have done

Finally! Change is good

This makes sense, but it makes me kinda sad because im not creative enough to make anything other than that. I guess now we will only see more creative memes now.

Ha, you fuckers are gonna have to get creative with your memes now.

So we don't have to suffer from cringe inducing Facebook messages that say "Jesus Christ you killed him dude" anymore?

can we get some example photos of headline or tweets with a photo that are okay? not having an example photo and reading that shorted my circuits but it made sense after seeing one. would be helpful for all the other dumbasses out there like myself reading this.

My prayers have been answered

You know, maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk.

Jk I agree these posts are cancer

THANK YOUUU

The only one of these that I actually liked were the text convo ones. Everything else can go get deleted.

Mods still gay but they're taking the first steps to bi

[secret leaks](https://youtu.be/DLzxrzFCyOs)

[Finally!](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/109/889/11c.gif)

Faith in sub restored!... A little. 

This will clean out a lot of the cancer, though. Good on you, mods.

[Sauce](https://imgur.com/gallery/NHW4u4J)

Nobody:

THE BATTLE IS WON

i clicked on all the links  
that was very sneaky of you

finally, thank god. hopefully we can get creative memes on this sub

AND on that day a new horizon was born. The old sun had set. A new sun emerged. One brighter and bigger than before.

I am for low restrictions but this will definitely improve the quality of the sub, good move.

bye Twitter

As someone who never posts, I agree

dang that's honestly all the memes on this sub

Epic moment

The only one I disagree with is the reddit comments one, they can sometimes be gold

Ah shit here we go again...

Now we just need to get rid of shitty announcement templates like the spiderman one and the Lisa Simpson one

#MODS STRAIGHT

Thank god

*takes a deep breath and exhales*

Haha, I've just made a post about this, finally

Good. r/okbuddyretard sorta took over as the spot for good obscure memes. This should hopefully put dankmemes back on the radar and quell the unoriginality thats been prevalent here.

how about screen shots of text with a caption on top

Will impact font memes be banned in the future?

Gay
But not too gay

YES THANK YOU

Maybe make a sub dedicated to reaction memes as well

Nah less rules, more memes. Even shitty memes.

r/memes was better anyways. Actually, why does this place exist? Theres dank memes and have always been in r/memes anyways. Was someone like no **I** wanna be mod! So they made their own

I give my mushroom stamp of approval.

Thank you dearly for listening, if only r/memes would ban these as well.

Good Anakin, good.

Thank you

Thank god

I agree that those are barely memes but some (like that twitter one, specifically that one though), or the text message one do make me laugh. So if any of y'all that make those are moving to another sub, let me know. 

The Gods have spoken!

Next ban white bar with image under it

This is nice and all, BUT WHY DID IT TAKE SO FUCKING LONG

Thank you base god

Thank god

amen

Will there be an option to report a meme for being a reaction meme?

Thank you Susan very cool

Hmmm maybe mods arnt gay but bisexual?? Hmmm

Preach

Thank God

They were one of the funniest things tho.

The headline posts are where I get my news, don't take those away from me

Thanks mods, perhaps I treated you too harshly

Thank you! that's a really nice change!! <3 <3 <3 
i love you all :)

Now they need to ban "wholesome" memes

for the facebook one i got saved by an add

i pressed the rick roll but then an ad came up instead

i was saved by my disabling adblock on youtube

Fucking resubscribed

Thats a good one

I both disagree and agree

Is it okay  to make memes of youtube titles with that roses are red ones...

FUCKING FINALLY!!!

Goddamn finally! Thank you so much

Good riddance

Mods banned reaction memes and unblock repostsleuthbot

Idk what to complain about know lol good job guys

Wow, this has really improved the quality of the memes here. I didn't even recognize the reaction meme meta.

Can we print out the twitter screenshot then take a photo with that?

Agreed

I normally don't stand for emojis, but this calls for a ... 

Don't really agree with this

good

Better!

Mods gay

Facebook will be removed!

Mods are promoted to Bi

Well... I don't know how to feel about this.

This is actually 90% of the content here

thanks for the music

Good idea although I thought  that Michael Jackson one was pretty funny but there will be casualties for the greater good.

the resurrection of our warrior past is about to begin

About time tbh

HOLY SHIT FINALLY

Today is a good day!

F O C K  Y A S S !!

fucking finally

What? Theyre making an effort to make dank memes dank again?

And everyone like that

Holy fuck the memes be dank once more

Thank fucking god

The facebook ones are terrible, just look at the example!

can we ban circlejerk memes too

Finally, inner peace.

How about caption images that adds nothing to the meme?

No screenshots but photos of texts? Im confused

Worst thing that's ever happened on this sub

Aaaaaand Im resubbed

Nice

You did scientific research on memes

Finally!

Destruction 100

Good

Now ban wholesome memes.

Youve single handily wiped out half of all reddit posts

Thank God

Wow yeah those Facebook memes people need to just give them up they keep letting the whole sub down

thank fucking god holy shit

Thank you

Thank god finally

I dont know. Sounds kinda gay.

Holy shit thank God

Really hate how Photosystem  occurs before Photosystem . Like, bruh.

mods are gay

Uh mods gay hahahshshhshahah.....I have bipolar depression

THE RAINBOW

Now this I like.

But like... what is left to post then? 

*this is a serious question*

You have obtained straight.

God Bless the Mods

What rule do I say they break when I report them?

make dank memes dank again

If your a mod are you les or gay if your a girl?

Can you ban everyone liked that next?

Very epic as said earlier

Wait but then what do everyone do if those still happen?

what about pornhub comments

Mods, I humbly promote you to bisexual

#OH MY GOD ITS HAPPENING THANK YOU SO MUCH FINALLY NO MORE

Rejoice

tfw mods use a meme that you created as an example of what not to do and you can't make a mfw meme about it.. :(

By the gods, I never thought I would see this day. It is finally here, brthers and sistrs!

Im surprised you didn't put the Helo meme at the beginning

Can we get rid of requiring captions be on the image and not the post next? A lot of memes get kind of ruined that way. The best memes of all fricken time (rickroll, Pepe, doge, etc) wouldnt exist had this rule been required of them. Also it will stop every meme from requiring a text box saying me when... or dae or x when or the like when it just could have been put in the post title , without ruining the image. The rule is redundant at best, limiting at worst.

Thank you. This sub may just become dank once more

This makes you a little bit less gay in my eyes

Absolutely based, thanks mods

Some were funny tho. Generally I agree

"everyone liked that"

Maybe this will lower the amoun of godawful "memes"

Thank you.

Text messages or chats are funny tho, why ban them?

This is probably an unpopular opinion but I feel like the sad [insert noun] noises is spammed a lot too

Holy shit the mods did something right.

Are you encouraging people to get creative?

Okay mr gay

finally. It's over Mr. Frodo. Tweets are gone

So for real when are we gonna ban tumblr posts

Totally agree with the idea,  and this subreddit has been flooded with the same memes over and over. 
Maybe this could change things for good or worse.

Thank fuck, mods are now upgraded to BiCurious

Gods be praised.

Agree totally, these reaction memes were retarded and too low effort

Youre telling me [this](https://imgur.com/a/RmI2iLP) is allowed but not [this](https://imgur.com/Idxlj2q)?

Does this mean no more "___ noises" memes?

Guess I'll die then

Thank you, you are a good and mildly less gay man.

The monster i have become template will also not be allowed?

Ah,victory

This is just great

Oh my god its finally happening

At last they did it

YES! FINALLY! THANK YOUUU!!!

You guys actually gonna enforce this or what?

Twitter is gone for good here, it was about time

Thank you so much

FUCKING THANK YOU OH MY GOD

Question time

Should I report them for "Not a dank meme" or "Normie trash"?

Head line memes were already banned in the past lmao

I got fucking Rick rolled by clicking those links. Goddammit.

Did I just get rickrolled by a mod

The Facebook one was actually pretty cool.

We deafeted the normie invasion my fellow dank users! Hurray!

woo

How do we properly report memes in violation of this new rule? Which option do we choose?

This could be a start of repairing dankmemes to its former glory

Thank god

Well thats fuckin gay

Honestly I like this but hate it

Bless the mods, a change for the better

mods straight

Thanks alot

Finally our prayers have been answered.

This is amazing news.

What if someone took a photo of a tweet? Should that be reported?

You are the gayest mod for the facebook one.

Also, the ShowerThoughts meme had the sub name censored as well as OP's u/. Is that what we're supposed to do, or just censor the u/?

Mods: no tt & fb reactions


Me: Print twitter text & photographs it.




Modern problems require modern solutions.

If something's dank, it's dank. Doesn't matter where it came from

1 like= Rick Rolled

Thank you, you mods arent as gay as I thought

Hazzah a Susan of quality!

So basically this whole subreddit is banned.

Finally no more twitter screen shots!

[Everyone Liked That]

Clark ?

J

Praise the mods!

Yeah, if you all could -actually- ban metareddit nonsense instead of having that rule collect dust while letting the first page of hot be constantly flooded by people talking about reddit and upvotes, that would be great.

THANK GOD

Finally some good fucking news ... thanks Susan !

Holy shit, they fixed the sub

lol they had to include the photo exception cause someone posted a print of a 2 page printout of their meme.

Does panik and kalm count?

Mods gay bro

This subreddit was good.... Now you can't do anything, you are like a dictature.

question: what if it is actually funny?

Why the fuck can't I post any memes....why do I now need 5k UPVOTES...whyy

Good, it started to get really annoying

Mods gay. ULTRA  gay.

HOLY SHIT thank you

I feel like Negotiator one is a loss, but everything else is fine

Can we also banish the girl vs boys meme? They are really annoying lmao

Rip text memes.. Good thing they werent funny.

Finally

reported the gay

But youre literally deleting 90% of the memes we like lmao i actually liked the obama medal template

Finally!

mods just Hamon Overdrive low effort memes

THANK YOU

 Nice

Guess Ill leave then.

No no, hes got a point

Ok

The amount od dank memes is too damn high!
I commend you for the ban of reaction memes. 
Well done geyz

Ok, maaaybe I can give this sub another chance

Were back to the golden age of meme

I can succ mods dick

Nice

DO NOT CLICK THE FACEBOOK LINK

That Facebook one can stay.

Nice

THANK YOU

There goes my meme idea

Thank god

so if I photograph a twitter post will it get banned or not?

photographs of text allowed but screenshots of text not allowed??????? explain

Just curious, which ones you considered "good though"

Good now fix the mods and tell them to stop being rats

epic

ban 69/420/64 memes pleaseeeee

its not like a majority the memes on this subreddit are already shit.

 me taking an irl picture of a tweet:
*laughs in sith lord*

A robot has its own free will, you know.

I know the system isnt perfect but how come you guys dont just take down the reaction memes the have reached hot, I mean shouldnt those be the easiest to spot and remove

And on this day, the mods of /r/dankmemes became slightly less gay.

In all seriousness though thank you so much for this change. Memes on reddit have been on a steady decline in terms of quality and hopefully this boosts it back up to where it used to be.

Wow, finally! Will you ban "They had us in the first half not gonna lie"?

Cc

Wow ok

As long as Ugandan Knuckles memes are still allowed, I'm fine with it.

We have a flair for low effort meme dumbasses. You mods are now even gayer

[deleted]

Way to take the fun out of everything. Isn't the internet supposed to be a place for kids to be free from rules?

If your banning this please ban coronavirus memes. They are the worst 2020 event meme

Personally, I disagree.  TL;DR, government intervention rarely works.    I mean, they are memes.  Just because they're low effort or not funny doesn't mean they shouldn't exist (ffs we've a flair for low effort ones).  I think though experimenting with what style of meme people like, Redditors accustom themselves with what they should or shouldn't post.  If you want to make a post discouraging this type of meme (or encouraging people to downvote them) you still are doing something, but banning the memes themselves won't help the sub improve on its own, which in my opinion would lead to a higher quality community in the end.

Edit: How about, everyone that's downvoting me, instead of just moving on(which doesn't help anyone), you explain why you think your opinion is correct?

Mods gay

I find twitter screenshots (and text memes in general) hilarious - why does everyone hate them?

Congrats! You just ruined the sub!

MEMES ARE MEMES! LOW EFFORT OR NOT, THEY ARE MEMES AND SHALL NOT BE CENSORED! WE ARENT CHINA!

These are literally all the memes that are ever posted here

If I clicked on the facebook one, but an ad pops up and you click off before you play the video?

I'll miss those memes

Well rip this sub

mods gay, even the examples here are good content. I am gonna switch subs probs because of this

I dont post these type of memes but these are like the best ones so this is fucking gay mods at work

What about emojis?

Why? These are memes too - some of the best ones imo. This new rule is fuckin stupid.

Damn, why you guys always submit to their demands? You guys have a spine or something to hold you together?

Cheers Susan, Nice one!

Reddit Susan > YouTube Susan (except for Reddit Susan's YouTube channel and Reddit Susan's premium snapchat)

Can we ban specific formats for reaction images like "holy shit that's boomer as fuck" or "thomas had never seen such bullshit before" or "it's all coming together now". Its low effort and the only funny part of those reaction memes is the image itself. The reaction just makes it less funny and I hate that shit.

The only good susan is this one

idk that cold war condom meme one was funny tho, i am of opinion that as long as the "reaction" (bottom part of the meme) actually matches the content of the top part (and it isn't low effort wholesome 100/everybody liked that/no no hes got a point/thats what heroes do/whatever the taste of the month is) then it should get a pass

You should ban Boys vs Girls memes. Theyre just awful and horribly unfunny.

I'm kinda tired of seeing those memes that have an article of some sad shit and having pictures of some guys crying and saluting. They aren't funny and are pretty depressing.

I also did a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modsgay/comments/f83751/change_of_rules_for_rdankmemes/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) about this some time ago. It went a little Un-noticed lol

Is that why I got a mods choice for my meme

Can we please for the love of god ban the Boys/ Girls format. Its overused and worn out and needs to die.

I think you guys solved the problem, thanks.

Still gay.

Thank you Susan

How is the reason called when reporting? Or is it just mod thing?

I'm assuming a screenshot of a YouTube video(Title and thumbnail) and an image(e.g: "I don't need sleep. I need answers") would be banned?

I thought my modmail plea was in vain, thank you so much for this

Great change. Mods not as gay anymore

I am worried you are still allowing a headline and Someone: (meme sentence). Is that true?

How and if where can I write a mod application?

What if its a reaction meme to a text?

I really dont think this covers everything. The issue is more of a broader one; mainly overuse in general. That includes 3 main things: overused reaction images (which hopefully this will help with), overused meme captions (such as the corona virus: normal people when sick:, people with corona virus: ), and other images that get used over and over again (images that people just add reaction images or other captions to). All three of these things get used, so that if theres ever a funny image, new caption, or other content and someone creates a meme with it, you can usually expect to see at least 50 different versions of that meme with alternate captions, or reaction images (usually overused ones) effectively ruining the meme.

One example is the corona meme as I mentioned above. Ive seen literally at least 50 different versions of the same joke/caption in the past week. Another is the new Phil swift format. It was literally exactly the same as the previous one, however just about all the captions that were used on the old format were put on the new one and most of them got a ton of upvotes.

Heres one example:

https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/comments/fdzg2u/they_all_look_the_same_and_speaks_noodles/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Another, same image:


https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/comments/fe3a4l/this_man_is_to_dangerous_to_be_alive/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Seen this caption already (different image)


https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/comments/fe0ul4/its_true/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

A meme where the text itself is funny on its own shouldnt be allowed tbh. Lot of the time the reaction doesnt add anything to it.

NOOOOOOOOOOO

How come text messages as well?

I get that you're a mod, but why is it too much to ask to just downvote something if you don't like it? Not everything you think isn't a good meme has to be banned off the subreddit. I hate this sort of mentality that people have.

Mods gay

Agreed

yeah...... https://youtu.be/yPYZpwSpKmA

I agree. Facebook is dead and the reactions to that is not good. I mean dank good

Disagree

Agreed

Agreed



(bursts through the door) The Spanish Inquisition!

does this means no minion memes

First time I have been rick rolled in a long time

Agreed

I despise you.

Agreed

Agreed

that's the only one I skipped cause I've seen enough of them. you made me go back....

Yeaaa let's just delete facebook all together.

Agreed

[removed]

Screw you 

People read those? It doesn't currently list any other situation we remove for this, I'm not sure theres room to list them all. even this segment of the rule is pretty big. It all falls under "Not a dank meme"

I thought it was decided awhile ago thats theyre not gay but in the middle but what does this make them now?

it's an old video but ok

Finally that shit was disgusting

Wut?

FUCK YEAH

Sadly only the texts

The subs been trash for months now theres no saving it anymore. Sad really

I clicked and I don't regret, never seen so many awards

I thought it would be a Rick roll.

Makes me feel old seeing that I cant comment on this anymore

i clicked and i regret

K-KONO POWA

Such a slow link.....NANI!?!?

God dammit

you can never escape the copy url then paste it and see it

NOOOOO

This one is broke as well, [this example](https://youtu.be/MRW7d7PIZ6U) works

never in my life have i seen so many awards

How did that get so many awards??

Username checks out

I dont even fall for these anymore, I just click them and upvote if theyre what I think they are cause its funny

Good question. I don't hate those. Probably banned under the current wording though.

Banned

I actually did leave it. This is my first time being on here in months. I may have to check back and see if its worth resubbing.

we have 150 mods who the median age is 13. So the rules need to lack nuance or they get confused and blow up the sub.  No picky, no posty

easy peasy

but the sex number 

How about memes completely reliant on them? Maybe not a total ban. The numbers are most definitely not a punchline. The numbers are tricky. It's almost like F for respect.

Her top posts are all Twitter screnshots, so you're not actually wrong...

Screenshots of TEXT. 

Boi....

But slightly less gay than before. Still gay tho

yeah

Now they bi

Forever and ever gay.

Maam! Its maam!

thanks for sticking around

ok

I'm pretty sure this is just a screenshot ban, so this sub will no longer just be spammed with twitter screenshots. Most of those reaction images are used on these types screenshots anyways so it will almost definitely be better all-around either way.

That will cut down a lot since there are no screenshots to react to

most of those arent even attempting humor and we should mostly be removing them

Especially when it's something random that no one knew about before.

not a dank meme

boi dont make me stop this car

I 100% agree with that statement

no I wouldnt think so

really if something is just so bad it's making you question reality, just ping me, you dont have to say why, I'll know

I didnt see one, the rule was made this way to be easy enough for even the mods who were dropped on their heads as babies

You can never clean out all the cancer. For small amounts, downvote, maybe report if you feel like it, and move on. It was getting bad though, so this is a good change.

well we haven't had it for four days

hmm I kind of agree, but it made it simpler. maybe we could make an exception if that's what people want. or if it's an image sub op could include that too. I'll think about it

They said it couldn't be done...

we all have our own thing, but the thing here was starting to be r/memes's thing

I think they were just re-introduced.

I cant handle any more subs but here are some ideas for names maybe if you want to 

r/MemesReact (like that shitty YouTube channel)

r/MemeReactions 

r/HowIFeltWhen

r/MyFeelingWhen

r/MyMemeReaction

gather round, storytime 

actually, r/memes is a lot older than r/dankmemes and I was a mod of both back then. At the time, the mod team of r/memes was almost entirely older redditors and one of them had some bad ideas about what the content should be, insisted memes must be impact font, top text, bottom text. You know, advice animals. 

You'll be glad to know that despite that rule, the sub was barely modded and other stuff was able to exist. But any talk of rules always had that one person who wouldnt budge, so the sub was anything goes until a  mod shows up and removes tons of content then disappears, rinse repeat. A volatile situation if you're invested in this hobby. 

Not sure the exact origin of dankmemes but the subs were extremely different back then.  What I was describing up there is Mr. Roger's facebook meme page. Dankmemes was very much not like that. The sub was openly racist, pro-trump, bigoted, and just rude, frankly. 

For some examples of the old dankmemes, check out the guy who added me and ended up disappearing after stealing [$800](https://www.reddit.com/r/eighthundreddollars), he was a real [sleazy guy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/search?q=author%3Avanillaskyhawk&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) He added me because he was hitting on me and also seeking mod spots (probably to try to sell more shit for $800). Kesha was later added for similar reasons. anyway... Also, here's [our old mascot who had his account suspended so it's like it's preserved in amber](https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/search?q=author%3aemersonic420&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) plus he posted [content in r/memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/search?q=author%3Aemersonic420&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) and you can see a perfect example of an ultra karmawhore cut off at the peak of it. These should tell you dankmemes wasnt a copycat of memes. It was more of a 4chan copycat, and just awful. 

If anything, we drifted towards r/memes, and to everyone who hates that, sorry but old dankmemes wouldnt exist, admins would have banned it. They almost did then. In fact, 3 years later, despite this sub being a decent community of nice kids, reddit is still punishing us by not letting the sub appear in the onboarding page for new accounts, and not letting your posts show up on r/popular. Yes, we have asked, and I guess we are still a racist hate group to admins because they have kept us restricted.  Oh well.

Kill him. Kill him now.

what kind of memes do you like

We are hesitant to change rules for small reasons, we wait until it looks like it's not a fad that's going away

not a dank meme

me too thanks

we need to pull together to get through this

Good memes

not a dank meme

it's one of those mysteries I dont know if we will ever discover

I think we already did

at least I used your meme rather than make my own like the others

yep. good luck taking over the sub with example a

If its reacting to text

example?

not a dank meme

some, not all

not a dank meme

I feel that way about bernie sanders

just the u/

why thank you

we recently dialed that rule back a little bit because we actually receive way more feedback that we are too heavy handed with it

people demanded it

that's fine, but we had to do something

Nice

someone already did it and got a ton of upvotes

hmm?

can't argue with that

when we made this decision, 40% of the top 50 were reaction memes. This sub is too busy to fully cover, its just the way it is. So we decided we needed to cut a percentage of them in order to maintain the health of the sub.

Thank you

I appreciate that you notice and care, makes it all worthwhile

Dont

hmmm.. no? try 4chan

dont worry, we have not yet seized the memes of production

*Congrats! You fixed the sub!

300IP

Exactly. That's how far the shithole this sub been in.

gonna be weird

RIP

still going strong in r/memes

come on, level with me, meme fan to meme fan, you dont actually like those do you? 

I dont normally go around recommending r/memes but they dont seem to have any restrictions on these. You can tell because the sub looks like a dumpster full of shit that is consumed by fire. 

But those memes are there.

It's called evolution. Embrace it.

Haha what do you mean rip? This sub has been ass for months.

k

Emoji bad circlejerk is wack but not worth banning

They're low effort and overused

They submit to our demands because they trust us.

thanks for not abandoning us

Or "No. No. He's got a point."

Aw you're so right

See, we have too many mods here, and that's too subjective. For a sub this size, rules must be objective

I hate them. Seeking to feel real emotion via cutesy memes grosses me out. wholesomememes etc

always ping me specifically, I don't mind.

not really that common. Even the most annoying format can chill here if it's not dominating the front page. We waited until it was 10 out of 50 to start moving to change. We really try to be careful about banning things because it could be cool again someday in the future when someone finds a better use. like dogelore

you'd hate it more if we suddenly micromanaged this place like that

It took a lot of research to get to this point. We hated to do that, because the best meme ever might have just been around the corner, but it was just too much of the sub, it was starting to change the nature of the place.

Rick Ashley has a song called giving up on love. Very big sads :( he said he would never give us up.

This was a surprise I did not see two capital Qs yet still got rick-rolled

A surprise to be sure, and definitely not a welcome one.

We don't use those here

They should list banned memes there though.

Mods gay

How the hell do you want new users to know whats illegal? This is why so many of us get our post deleted without ever know ing why. Pleaze update it.

You should add more reasons under the it breaks this subreddits rules for the report section.

It helps us report when saying it breaks the subreddit rules.

Thank you susan

better question

how dare youtube

Ironic

Sad gang rise uppppp

I mean like what formats are left to post?

Sad

Im not trying to take over the sub. Im genuinely confused. The inclusion of the image seems extremely trivial. If people wanted too, they could just add an image into the meme like I showed. I dont understand why one would be banned and not the other because they are functionally the same exact meme. 

Also, the rule about taking pictures of text being ok makes even less sense to me. The example you showed looked like it was from a textbook. Does that mean its fine if you take a picture of the physical copy but not fine if you took a digital copy of the same textbook and took a screenshot of the same text? 

Also what if someone were to print out a twitter screenshot and then take a picture of the paper they printed out? Would that not be banned even though its functionality the same as simply posting the screenshot with a reaction image? Also, since you didnt ban white bar memes all together, someone could just take a twitter screenshot or Reddit title/comment and re write what it says word for word and then put a reaction image. Under this rule, that wouldnt be banned but simply posting the title/comment/twitter screenshot with a reaction image would be even through they are the same thing.

Basically Im confused because this rule places great emphasis on trivial details.

Finally. They were never funny anyway

Thanks mate. Will do

Oh

Thank you dank mod

ok thanks for clarification

Bring back public flogging.

So that something was to delete all of them? Great logic

Nice

damn

I dont mean to sound rude and dont mean to insult the work of the mods. But just out of curiosity do you stop the memes when they are rising or when they are in the hot tab. Because if you stop them in the rising tab then that might be an affective way of stopping them from rising but wouldnt having someone look over the hot tab to show the majority of people that theyre isnt much lack luster content. This is assuming that most people look at the hot tab in which case shouldnt it be prioritized for the sake of looking good? Well maybe I dont know what Im talking about but I appreciate you thanking the time to answer my question

say sike right now

Thank you susan for looking out for us normies

Memes that are only that are annoying and not even really memes but if they add something on to like some of your examples it I'd say it's a real meme and usually enjoyable.

This is more like cutting off a limb.

Devolution

So they don't have a spine. Couldnt expect more from gaymods

Thank you Susan, very cool!

Ay don't worry about it. You guys are doing a great job!

I'm not saying the few memes I've made are good. There's a reason I haven't made a lot.

Memes that you dont just slap picture like the professionals have standards below a tweet

because we wanted to kill some, but not all. Traffic for the sub was down and users were upset that the front page was becoming saturated with reaction memes. Even the people posting them to karmawhore expressed to me privately that they kept their better content for other subs, because dankmemes had stopped upvoting traditional memes and high effort posts. 

if it seems arbitrary, its because we didnt want to eliminate the entire concept of a reaction meme, but we wanted to drastically reduce the amount of them to  bring some balance to the sub.  Twitter and headlines, those made up about half of reaction memes, and we already disallow twitter screenshots as memes, and these are just that with a picture on the bottom so it seemed like a good place to start. 

We collected a bunch of examples of the highest upvoted all text ones and honestly, to us, there weren't many that were worth the destruction to the sub.

The screenshot/photo distinction was made because the textbook one I thought was pretty funny and the idea here isn't to remove as much as possible, it's to surgically remove the worst. How many photos of text are going to dominate the front page? Not many. And that's all we are worried about. 

Also, keep in mind, any directive given to 150 15 year old mods needs to be easily understood, so we figured "no reaction to text" doesn't leave a ton of room to fuck up, and it made the most sense for the situation, so we went with that.

Nice

We couldnt stop those. It was too much. But we have mods in a bunch of different places in the sub

These kinds of memes were funny the first, maybe 3 times. Know what is a good meme that lasted a good while, and died out naturally (As much as a meme can)? Me and The Boys. That was good.

Susan runs autobot confirmed.

It's a reference to the investment system over on r/DankExchange, we're one of r/dankmemes' brand new sister subs! We had a crossover event a few weeks ago and we're in talks of another at some point in the next month or two.

Can you give me some examples?

This is art. That is why you made it.

PRESSUER!!

Good music, good meme

Thought that said ice age baby and I was so confused

It has a ting in it, its not the same. - Vanilla Ice

Then the remix be like "MULTI-TRACK DRIFTING"

[                ](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)

One is a great song made by amazing people the other is ice ice baby

Needs an award

So if the train goes to the under pressure track, does it split into 2 more with david Bowie and queen? 

Who do you choose?

Under pressure man David Bowie and queen are awesome

sorry, Queen al the way

I can hear this image.

The first measure is different for Ice Ice Baby. That's how they justified using the riff in their song, they added an additional eighth note at the end

MULTI TRACK DRIFTING!!!!

10/10

Took too long for me to realize that it didn't say "lee ice baby"

You made it because whatever god you might or might not believe in channeled through youto make a beytiful art piece

10 out of 10 nice cock-I mean meme

I hate Vanilla Ice for this

Genius meme

Wait I don't get it

But there are no people on streets

Everyone is getting gold but OP

This is amazing, I'm actually laughing

It be like that sometimes

I'm sorry, what is this referencing?

I don't know why either but I like it. You must always like the classics

So fucking good

This is beautiful, I love it!

*Insert Multi track drifting! Meme*

I havent felt this way about a meme in a while

Iee

When you hear the start of the music and get ready to sing to joke with your girl but you only remember ice ice baby

Under Pressure

Talk about derailment

Nothing will be ever better describe this feeling as well as this post

OMG this is genius

Can someone explain this to my uneducated self

Now this is what I call a quality original meme. Congratulations.

Hey, this is actually good

lol didnt someone get sued over this

I dont have any Reddit coins but Im giving this an award in spirit

They have different high hats at the beginning. Under Pressure starts with a sustained high hat then goes to the bass line, while Ice Ice Baby has about four or five short, sampled ones before going to the bass line. Theyre both easily distinguishable before you even hear the bass.

I thought it said ice age baby

Dundun dun dundundundun (repeat)

Multi-track drifting!

Beautiful girls and stand by me

YES

DUAL TRACK DRIFTING

?

Fuck I read Ice Age Baby instead of Ice ice baby

I dont get it Im kinda dumb

Some people in these comments dont know what a sample is

It was sampled

#DING DING DING DOOOOOOOW

Ice ice pressure

Under pressure is always the right way to go but still... I do love an occasional ice ice baby here and there

MULTI TRACK DRIFTING

At first I thought the bottom said ice age baby and I was staring at the meme for 5 minutes trying to understand

Turn the lever at the right point and have both

Choose the queen not baby ice doo doo doo doo doo doo

ah a man of culture I see

It always turns for me, it never goes straight :(

Me: "Can we have Under Pressure?" 

Mom: "No we have Under Pressure at Home" 

Under Pressure at Home:

IGGY GET OUT OF THERE HE'S STILL ALIVE!

Dont you mean, ice age baby? Then take that path and run over the bastard.

um actually ice ice babys bassline changes before the first measure even finishes

Alright stop

My dumb ass thought it said ice age baby

Yes! Run over ice age Baby!! Oh, it's ice ice Baby. My Bad.

Ice Ice baby is such a good song I should start listening to it again

Always ice ice baby

The rhythm is slightly wrong. Why is there a dot there?

Edit: Never mind I had a brain fart. Different type of dot.

I read that as ice age baby and was so confused

I mean, from the sheet music, that's already Under Pressure.

For Ice Ice Baby, you'd have to replace the quarter rest with an eighth rest followed by an eighth note of the higher pitch.

It better turn right

Dual-track drifting!

Ice age baby? Makes me angry

Ice Ice Baby has one extra chord compared to Under Pressure. That's how they didn't get sued.

Jolly good meme

This is quality

Was skiing indoors one. Thought ice ice baby was playing cos it would be perfect, my day was ruined and my disappointment was immeasurable

Somebody explain pls

I read it as Ice age baby

MULTI TRACK DRIFTING

'Ice ice baby'

It do be like that sometimes.

Its Muller

dun dun dururun durururun

Its called a sample ffs

I cant fucking read notes. Thats probably why at suck at the trombone in band class.

The songs are so different but everyone acts like they are the same because of like 1 of music

Just multi track drift

Under Pressure came first lmfao

Same

I don't know either, but I'm glad you did.

I don't get it

Wtf is " lee ice baby"?

I would use these songs back to back as a radio dj.

I dont get it

Assuming that the measure shown in the meme is the first measure of the song, we can safely assume that this is Under Pressure, as 'ice ice baby' only has a 1/8th rest at the end of the first measure whereas 'Under Pressure has a 1/4th rest as shown in the meme.

&#x200B;

try again OP

Aeps stronk

Alright stop, collaborate and listen. Ice is back with a brand new addition. Something, grabs a hold of me tightly. I flow like a harpoon daily and nightly. Will it ever stop? Yo, i dont know! Turn off the lights, and Ill glow. To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal. Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle!

Thats all I can remember lol

Queen did it better

The original trolley problem.

I dont understand why that staccato marking is there

Headcanon; someone actually saw my Goku meme yesterday.

Ice Ice baby suck my ass. Ice Ice Baby was created by Ice Age Baby.

Beyond god tier

                

Under pressure sucks.

Under pressure was first and ice ice baby Made it a bit more famous

Just like "every breath you take" from police and "I'll be missing you" from p diddy... Gets me every time.

Ape strong when together

Theyre actually slightly different, even though the video of vanilla ice trying to explain it makes him look rarted.

Under pressure goes

>ta-ta-ta-tiddy-ta-ta

>ta-ta-ta-tiddy-ta-ta

While ice ice baby goes

>ta-ta-ta-tiddy-ta-ta

>TA-ta-ta-ta-tiddy-ta-ta

There are *four* notes before the tiddy when the phrase repeats the second time. You now have a degree in music, aka more toilet paper in these trying times.

Legend

If u were rich I'd eat u whole UwU

PUSHING DOWN ON ME...

The reputation of a thousand years may be determined by the conduct of one hour.

Vanilla ice age baby

Same lmao

Did he actually say that?

Lol hes not wrong tho. There is a slight difference although my brain defaults to Queen

UNDER ICE PRESSURE BABY

Im retarded

Bowie

Queen

Im sorry all queen fans, but Bowie is 10 times better than queen.

One of the best queen songs imo and that applies to David too

Dont forget about David

Killer Queen has already touched the upvote button

Por qu no los dos? : Jedward

Correct. The quarter note rest gives away that this is Under pressure.

Ice ice baby has the same basslines as under pressure

They have the same opening.

The intro is the same but Under Pressure doesn't have the same melody throughout, Ice Ice Baby does. Under Pressure has more instruments and vocals too.

:(

Both songs have the same rythem

Both songs start with the same melody on the bass

Ok maybe you need to listen to the songs again because there's only silence "before you even hear the bass" in both songs. It's literally how they start.

And some people are presumptuous assholes who won't back themselves up when they're called out

That would include Vanilla Ice then since he claims that it isnt, and he's even added an extra note in his to try to avoid any copyright claim.

Man of culture (!)

No, Under Pressure topped the charts in 1982. Just young gen knows Ice Ice Baby better. Its like Maria Maria from Santana, everbody knows it except new gen and we cannot say Rihannas song (songs name is wild?) made it popular

Apes together strong*

I see tiddy I upvote

This is the exact quote Vanilla Ice used to defend himself in an interview. Honestly though, adding one note doesnt make it original piece of music.

Isnt the second ta of the four the one on beat one though? So the meme is inaccurate, as the songs diverge on the and of 4, not the first beat of the next measure

Here's the video:
https://youtu.be/6TLo4Z_LWu4

Yeah the extra note is on the first bar though, it's on the up beat right before the second bar, so

>ta-ta-ta-tiddy-ta-ta---ta  
>  
>ta-ta-ta-tiddy-ta-ta-----

I do like tiddys. Excellent work Watson!

Ok boomer

Bowie was absolutely amazing in that. The way he carries the vocals ..wow



Oh wait was about queens song lol now I feel stupid and thanks

Im sorry OP

Yeah

Apes stronger when together

I feel like this comment reinforced the meme.

Gibe tiity pictuar?

he later claimed that this statement was a joke, was sued by Queen, settled out of court, and now has to pay for using the sample.

He literally used the sample from Under Pressure.

It's not that noticeable as opposed to the lyrics, so the author propably meant that.

NO MAN ASK FOR...

Seems about right

nope, XcQ = link stays blue

You outsmarted me but I outsmarted your outsmarting

The way he takes the wheel in the last verse is just awesome. Best part of the song

And although he wished for death..

Haha no problem. :)

They have the same little riff in it.
